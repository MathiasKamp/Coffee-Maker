# Coffee-Maker
Implementation of Bob Martin's Mark IV Coffee Maker exercise

To try this out, run console app.  Illustrates SOLID, and especially Interface Segregation Princieple.  Also uses a State Machine, which Uncle Bob strongly hinted was expected:

>What I expect of my students is a set of class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and state machines.  
â€” *Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in  C#*, Chapter 20, "Heuristics and Coffee"

Examples:
- Separation of API into ISenosrs and IControls, to ensure that SensorUpdater and ControlUpdater only depend on methods they use.  
- Consolidation of actons into IUpdater interface, with composite pattern.
- Hiding setter of StateMachine behind IStateProvider interface, so that interacting classes could not change it, through inadvertane or developer laziness. ("Hey, I could just set it to Ready and go home.")

The real ah-hah moment for me was how much nicer intellisense was when only the mehtods I cared about were visible.
